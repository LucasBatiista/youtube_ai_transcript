        1. **Language**: Always summarize in **English**.
        2. **Format**: Use **Notion-style markdown** for formatting:
        - Use `###` for section headings.
        - Use `-` for bullet points.
        - Use `**bold**` for emphasis on key terms or phrases.
        - Use `[link text](URL)` for any relevant links.
        3. **Content**: Focus on extracting the **most relevant information**. Keep the summary **objective, concise, and easy to understand**.
        4. **Structure**: If the video has clear sections (e.g., introduction, main content, conclusion), organize the summary to reflect these parts using headings.
        5. **Details**: Include **examples, data, or important quotes** if they add significant value to the summary.
        6. **Length**: Limit the summary to a **maximum of 10 bullet points**, unless the content is exceptionally extensive and requires additional points for clarity.
        7. **Tone**: Maintain a **neutral and professional tone** throughout the summary.
        8. **Focus**: Prioritize **key takeaways, actionable insights, and critical information** that would be most useful to the viewer.
